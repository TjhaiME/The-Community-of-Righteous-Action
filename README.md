# A Permanent Community Hub

> This is not a vibe, a meetup, or a symbolic gesture.
> This is an attempt to build **real infrastructure** for people who are already resisting, already caring, and already exhausted by pretending events are enough.

## 1. Why this needs to exist

There is a large, neglected community out here that wants to do more.

Many people:

* stopped coming to protests because they don’t feel represented,
* can’t attend events at the times or places decided in the city,
* or are excluded by cost, burnout, culture, disability, family, or plain exhaustion.

This is not a motivation problem.
It’s an **infrastructure problem**.

Resistance has been reduced to moments instead of environments.

---

## 2. What we keep relearning (and then abandoning)

When we had encampments or permanent protests:

* people met organically,
* conversations happened without scheduling,
* skills and ideas crossed between movements,
* new actions emerged *because people were co-present*.

Those sparks didn’t come from slogans.
They came from **shared space**.

We keep dismantling the very conditions that make resistance sustainable.

---

## 3. The material reality we are ignoring

Out here:

* fruit and vegetables are sometimes **up to 10× cheaper** than monopoly-controlled city markets,
* people have backyards instead of balconies,
* rent pressure is lower,
* unused space exists.

Among us:

* some people have time,
* some have money,
* some have skills that make an hour-long task take a minute.

Pooling these differences:

* saves **time** (often more valuable than money),
* increases total capacity without increasing burnout,
* allows people to give *what they actually have*.

This also enables:

* hiring within the community (e.g. labourers who support our movements),
* keeping money circulating locally,
* increasing local money multipliers.

We currently duplicate resources privately while being price-gouged collectively.

This is irrational.

---

## 4. What is actually being proposed

A **permanent, shared community hub** based in an existing house in Liverpool.

Not an organisation.
Not a brand.
Not a closed religious or cultural centre.

A **node** that:

* connects different communities,
* supports different modes of participation,
* and reduces dependence on colonial, monopolistic systems.

This is a bridge, not a silo.

---

## 5. Why *this* house, *now*

This house currently has:

* no housemates,
* available rooms,
* large garden space,
* storage and work areas,
* existing tools and equipment.

Directly next door is an **empty lot** that could easily become a community garden.

The surrounding area already has strong social density:

* people are out on the street,
* neighbours talk,
* informal networks already exist.

This is an old‑school condition for community building — but it requires **a shared base**, not an individual trying to connect alone.

Using this house **now**:

* turns idle capacity into shared infrastructure,
* allows connection to happen collectively rather than through individual social labour,
* creates a working demonstration others can copy (including people with much nicer houses),
* lowers the barrier for people currently locked out of city‑centred spaces.

Opportunities like this are temporary.

If we wait for perfect conditions, this never happens.

---

## 6. Existing shared resources (already here)

This is not theoretical. Resources available now include:

* multiple computers
* a 3D printer
* soldering and electronics equipment
* DIY tools, tape, paint, materials
* BBQs and indoor/outdoor cooking capacity
* significant garden space

These are things many activists already buy or access individually.

Sharing them:

* saves money,
* saves time,
* increases access,
* and weakens monopolies without asking anyone to sacrifice quality of life.

The surrounding area also offers:

* cheap local food,
* a high density of small businesses supportive of our cause,
* easier bulk deals and local sourcing,
* fewer neighbours likely to complain about sound.

---

## 7. Food sovereignty is not optional

If we want a real alternative movement, food sovereignty is foundational.

It must:

* start in backyards,
* scale through sharing and bulk cooking,
* reconnect people to food outside corporate supply chains.

Long-term possibilities include:

* backyard growing networks,
* shared meals as organising infrastructure,
* edible nature corridors that support non-human life as well.

This directly challenges colonial extraction while meeting immediate needs.

---

## 8. Culture, religion, and collective survival

Religion is not just metaphysics.
It is **oral wisdom developed under conditions of oppression**.

Across African, Arab, and other colonised cultures, it contains:

* instructions for collective labour,
* shared food systems,
* extended family responsibility,
* care beyond the nuclear household.

This space is not about enforcing belief.
This space is about trying to set an example others can be inspired to follow.
It is about **recovering practices** that Western colonisation actively dismantled.



---

## 9. Learning from what still works

Many cultures already maintain models of collective survival.

Arab families — like many others — have repeatedly shown:

* the ability to cook for many collectively,
* to share labour without formal management,
* to support people materially without turning care into spectacle.

Historically in immgrant communities, Arab families stuck together beyond just the family, but there is less of this now that corporate society and white people are more inclusive. We gained financial benefits but lost a lot of community.

Historically, mosques, churches, and similar spaces were not just sites of belief.
They functioned as:

* welfare systems,
* community kitchens,
* organising bases,
* places people could stay when they needed support,
* and sites of creative charity.

This space aims to bring that **same attitude** into our political community.

For many of us, these movements:

* showed up when others didn’t,
* form bonds stronger than friendship,
* and create shared purpose that functions like extended family.

Many of us trust those in the movement more than our own friends and family.

This is not about blood ties.
It is about **connection through shared struggle**.

Not excluding people through identity.
Uniting people through **righteous action**.

---

## 10. What this space can concretely support

This hub can host, simultaneously or over time:

* large shared meals and family BBQs
* bulk production (e.g. mamoul tables, meal‑prep chains)
* community gardening on‑site and next door
* teaching spaces (political education, skills, history)
* self‑defence and physical training
* podcasting and voice recording for those unheard elsewhere
* temporary support for immigrants between jobs (case‑by‑case)

Many of these activities also enable **fundraising**:

* selling food made collectively,
* producing goods without middlemen,
* redirecting value away from monopolies and into community use.

Contribution does not need to look like organising.

People can contribute in culturally familiar ways —
by feeding organisers,
by providing labour,
by offering space, tools, or quiet support.

Participation does not require confidence, charisma, or constant presence.

---

## 11. How this is different from existing spaces

* not city‑centred, we are where our people are
* not protest‑only
* not limited to one identity group
* not dependent on constant burnout cycles
* not controlled by moderates defining acceptable speech

This is not about creating family because of loneliness.

It is about rebuilding **infrastructure that historically existed**,
that allowed communities to reproduce themselves materially, politically, and culturally.

This is infrastructure people can **plug into**, not perform within.

Naturally this will also reduce lonliness and burnout in our community.

---

## 12. The colonial contradiction (said plainly)

We are living on colonised land.

Many of us benefit daily from systems we claim to oppose elsewhere.

The task is not moral purity.
It is to:

* reduce dependence on colonial systems,
* without demanding people immediately lose the benefits tying them to those systems.

This is what **seizing the supply chain** actually means:

* redirecting food,
* labour,
* money,
* and care

away from monopolies and toward community control.

Without building alternatives here:

* our resistance remains symbolic,
* and our politics remain extractive.

This hub is one attempt to confront that honestly.

---

## 13. The offer (no posturing)

This house is being offered as a shared resource.

* Keys can be given to people who are serious.
* The space can operate with **24/7 access**.
* Rent will continue to be covered independently (although help is appreciated).

This is not about control.

It is an attempt to:

* remove barriers to use,
* prevent gatekeeping,
* and allow the space to be shaped collectively.

Use it.
Organise in it.
Cook in it.
Teach in it.
Rest in it.
Improve it.

This is about **creating community where it currently doesn’t exist**.

---

## 14. What is actually needed

To seed this properly, we need:

* people who take the idea seriously,
* people willing to help build it into a real space,
* people who can bring others they trust,
* people willing to share skills, labour, and resources.

The space is open to everyone.

But the **first layer** matters.

Seeding it with committed people creates:

* safety,
* momentum,
* and clarity of purpose.

From there, everything else can flow.

No perfection.
No purity tests.
No forced visibility.

---

## 15. Closing

If resistance is treated like a hobby, it burns people out.

If it is treated like family, it becomes sustainable.

This is one node.
One attempt.
One opening.

What happens next depends on whether we choose to use it.

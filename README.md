# The Community of Righteous Action
## Step 1: Building an Alternative System Together

We are not lacking resources. We are lacking coordination and courage.

Our community already contains time, skills, labour, money, care, networks, and knowledge. What breaks us is that these resources are channelled outward—into monopolies, rent, extractive supply chains, and colonial systems designed to move value away from the people who live here.

This is not a moral failure. It is an infrastructure problem.
So we build our own.

Not by waiting. Not by asking permission.
By coming together and redirecting what already exists.

## What We Are Building (Now, Not Later)

One shared organising infrastructure that allows people to:
- ask for help
- offer what they have
- coordinate logistics
- pool leverage
- circulate money and labour locally
- act together without hierarchy or gatekeeping

Not a charity. Not a discussion group.
An alternative system that produces power.

It starts with a digital organising space that can handle real work:
- multiple conversations at once
- proposals, offers, needs, and research
- coordination without chaos

Nothing is dictated. Projects emerge from use.
Disagreement is healthy. Deliberate derailment is not.
If you want to work differently, start a parallel effort inside the same ecosystem.

## Food as Power (Immediate and Material)

Food is where coordination turns into leverage fast.

Fruit and veg are significantly cheaper in Liverpool and surrounding areas than in much of the city. Many of us already travel back and forth.

By pooling orders:
- we buy in bulk
- we save money
- we bypass monopolies
- we deal with shops B2B, not as isolated consumers

That changes the relationship.

Large, consistent orders mean:
- bulk pricing
- negotiated discounts
- conditions

Yes—conditions.

We choose shops that support Palestine.
We can say: *if we’re buying here this week, fly the flag*.
With enough volume, this isn’t asking—it’s bargaining.

Distribution can happen where we already gather: rallies, meetups, community spaces.
Who loses: price-gouging monopolies.
Who wins: everyone else.

This makes boycotts practical, lowers costs, creates logistics work, and demonstrates collective leverage in practice.

## Logistics Is Colonial Power in Australia

Australia’s economy is designed to move wealth out, not to move care, food, or resources through the continent for the people who live here.

Supply chains prioritise ports, exports, and extraction—not inland communities, not remote regions, not First Nations people.
That is the colonial design.

If we become good at logistics—real logistics—we build anti-colonial capacity.

Every time we:
- coordinate transport
- aggregate demand
- distribute without monopolies
- move goods cooperatively across distance

we rehearse an alternative infrastructure.

These skills scale:
- to supporting inland and remote communities
- to responding faster than institutions
- to strengthening First Nations-led initiatives (on their terms)
- to making our own systems more resilient

Food is the entry point.
Logistics mastery is the long-term capacity.

In this country, whoever controls logistics controls possibility.

## Labour, Skills, and Services (Kept in the Community)

We already have:
- labourers who need work
- people who need labour
- people who want to spend money in the community
- people willing to work for food or mutual support, not just cash

Right now there is no way to connect them.

This system creates that connection.

Inside the space:
- people request labour or services
- others offer skills or time
- exchanges can be money, food, or support

This increases the local money multiplier.
Value circulates instead of leaking upward.
Burnout turns into reciprocity.

Helping someone here is not charity.
It is participation in a network that will help you later.

## Our Own Funding Pool (Direct and Equal)

Anyone who wants to contributes $1 or more per month.
Every contributor gets one vote.

Some give more. Voting power stays equal.

Funds are allocated by direct democratic voting to:
- community projects
- emergency support
- local and international mutual aid
- organising spaces and logistics

Shared research matters.
Information about what aid is effective *right now* must be visible to voters.
Collective intelligence becomes collective decision-making.

This is not symbolic democracy.
It is practice.

---

## Consistent Gathering Is Infrastructure

Online coordination is not enough.

Protests are overwhelming.
Many feel alone even in crowds.
Some don’t use online platforms.
Some are elderly, exhausted, or barely holding on.

Consistent in-person spaces:
- prevent isolation
- spark collaboration
- keep people alive
- turn strangers into comrades

Meals, music, low-pressure gatherings matter.
Festival communities understand this.
So did spiritual orders and resistance movements across history.

Action has always required rhythm, presence, and joy.

---

## This Already Exists

None of this is new.

Many of us already belong to communities that share resources, circulate money internally, organise care, and act collectively.

The problem is not scarcity.
The problem is fragmentation and fear.

We don’t replace existing communities.
We connect them into an ecosystem.

All the resources already exist.
The question is where we direct them.

---

## The Only Ask

Not agreement.
Not sacrifice.
Not spare time or money you don’t have.

Just this:

**Help build and use a shared space where people can ask, offer, coordinate, and act together.**

Everything else grows from there.

**The Community of Righteous Action**
Not united by identity.
United by action.
